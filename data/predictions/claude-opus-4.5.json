The Play-off 2 winner (likely a team from the intercontinental playoff between lower-ranked confederations) will face a massive quality gap. France's depth, experience at major tournaments, and home-continent advantage (playing in North America with strong fan support) should see them control this match comfortably. The 98-position ranking difference is substantial, and France typically performs well in group stage openers. A clean sheet is expected given France's defensive quality against a significantly weaker opponent."
