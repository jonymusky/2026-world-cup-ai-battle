Canada's 2022 World Cup experience (0 points, eliminated in group stage) shows vulnerability despite potential.

Algeria has stronger World Cup pedigree, having reached the Round of 16 in 2014, and possesses more experience at the international level. Jordan, while improving in recent years, has less experience on the world stage. The 31-position ranking gap suggests Algeria should control the match. Playing at a neutral venue in San Francisco removes home advantage. Algeria's technical quality and tournament experience should see them secure a comfortable victory in this Group J opener, though Jordan's defensive organization may limit the margin."
