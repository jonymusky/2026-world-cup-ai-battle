Neutral venue conditions reduce any home-edge effects. Expect Qatar to control more of the game and convert one chance per half, with the play-off side competitive but limited in attack."

Scotland are typically organised and competitive against top sides, but they tend to create fewer high-quality chances and can struggle to sustain pressure against elite attackers over 90 minutes. In a group match at a neutral venue, Brazil’s superior attacking quality and ability to control territory should translate into a controlled win, most likely by a couple of goals without needing a shootout."

Haiti can be competitive and athletic but tend to struggle against top-20 opponents, especially in controlling midfield and limiting high-quality chances. In a group-stage setting, Morocco are likely to manage the game and win without needing to open up excessively, pointing to a controlled 2–0 type result."

Paraguay are typically organized and hard to break down, which points to a tight, low-to-moderate scoring game rather than a blowout. On a neutral venue (Vancouver), Australia’s athleticism and pressing/transition threat give them a slight advantage, but Paraguay’s set-piece danger keeps them competitive—hence a narrow 2-1 Australia win."

Ecuador are well-organized and athletic (CONMEBOL resilience, dangerous in transitions and set pieces), but they’re more likely to struggle sustaining possession and generating high-volume chances against elite opposition.

On neutral ground in Miami, neither side has a major contextual edge, so a cautious game with few clear chances is likely, making a 1-1 draw the most balanced call."
