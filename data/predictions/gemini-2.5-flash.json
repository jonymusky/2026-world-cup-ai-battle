Their technical quality in midfield and attack will likely create several scoring opportunities. However, Uruguay (ranked 9) is known for its strong defense, physicality, and dangerous counter-attacks, often featuring clinical finishers. They will make it a tough contest and are capable of finding the net, but Spain's overall quality and ability to break down resilient defenses should see them secure a narrow victory in this group stage encounter."
