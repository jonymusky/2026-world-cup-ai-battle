                     ### Git Commit Messages

                     - Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
                     - - Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
                       - - Limit the first line to 72 characters or less

                         - - We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting
                           - - Run `pnpm lint` before committing
